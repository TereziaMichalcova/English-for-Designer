# Again

So here we go again. Literally. I have a very complicated relationship with this word. As of today we accept each other’s existence, but we still struggle to get along completely. But that is alright because life is just a big never ending learning experience and I am living for the first time so bear with me. 
From my early years I hated the sound of the phrase: “do it again”. Why? Why go to all the trouble of doing something again when it was done already? Wasn’t it good enough for the first time? Am I not good enough to do it on the first try? I hated doing things again. Because I didn’t want to, because it was boring the first time, because I started to doubt myself and my being perfect the first time mentality wasn’t a good friend of doing things again. Once or never. There is only one chance in life to get it right. But is there? And every time I failed I was reminded my wish for perfection on the first try is not possible as well as it is very exhausting to maintain.
On the one hand I was thought there is always a second chance in everything, but on the other hand I always put pressure on myself to be the best or perfect as much as possible.
