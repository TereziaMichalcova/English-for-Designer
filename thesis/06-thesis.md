### Introduction

Hi everybody, Teresa here. Today I would like to introduce you to the topic of my bachelor thesis.

### What is it?

In our family library there was always this book about history of architecture and its styles, characteristics, symbols and it fascinated me how much information one small book can hold. I loved to scroll through the book, look at the sketches and read about different periods of time. Architecture is a beautiful testament of older times and I wanted to share my passion for this topic.
I knew I wanted to do a children's book for my thesis and it became an obvious choice to combine the topic of architecture with the form of a book. 
I took inspiration as well from a project called Listovatel, where a designer Karla Gondeková created beautifully illustrated exercise sheets for children in early school years. 
I know with children there are two sides – who either hate reading, cannot hold attention to reading a book or the bookworms that cannot let go of a book. So I wanted to meet them in the middle and created an interactive guide – Urban journal – through chosen 8 places in Prague, where they can read some fun facts about the buildings and do some fun activities related to the place.

### Concept of the journal

At each location there are 2 contrasting buildings that we learn about. Starting chapter with a landscape with both buildings, next double page is introduction of first building and following with activity for the place. Then the second building with its own activity to do.

### The Form

The Form of the journal was chosen cleverly – small enough to fit in a pocket or a smaller bag > it is a travel book after all, and big enough for children to freely scribble around as they need. Also I skipped numbering the pages and instead I placed 8 pictograms for 8 chapters that are in the book – with a special colour for each so it is easy to navigate through.

### Illustration

The illustration process led me to choose simple lineart with adding colour where needed. The final coloured illustration you will see in the final product when it‘s out. Here you can take a peek at the page layout. And down here you can see peeking our guide!

### Engineer Crane

Engineer Crane is a fun character that guides children through the book and gives fun facts! His “elasticity” makes him able to have beak in everything 😆.  I very much enjoyed creating such a fun and on point character. He is just perfect for the book.

### “Journaling”

Journaling is important part of this book. After each introduction of the building there is an activity for children to do at the place – it is directly connected to the area so they'll learn something about the building, place or historical events. With this creative learning process they soak up the information much easier and they get to be creative with it.
