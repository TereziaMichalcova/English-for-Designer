### Summer House
*(architecture)*

![Mood picture of the house](Architektura.png)

My university journey started at architecture. Where the spark for graphic design lighted up in me. This particular project I designed for Czech actress Lenka Zbranková in Sázava as her summer house. Lovely environment of the countryside and her **delicate** personality led me to designing **spacious** common areas for her lively entertaining and **calm, simple** private rooms for her to unwind and recharge after long day. I learned to listen to the client, work with space and materials.

But my path led me more into graphic design...

### Czech School without Borders, London
*(visual identity)*

![Czech School logo](CzechSchool_uvod.png)

This is a visual identity for Czech School without Borders, London and together we designed a **versatile** visual system, reflecting the **unique** and **creative** educational process of the school. We created a **playful iconography** based on sticker like appearance. It is not only **fun element** but also **practical tool** to classify all the activities the school provides. We wanted to **incorporate children** themselves to be part of their school identity by using their precious artworks and creations.

### Indigo
*(board game)*

![Indigo visuals](Indigo1.png)

At the end of the second year of college we got a lovely assignment to create a unique board game. Working in team we approached this a little unconventionally. We paired **classic game** pieces moving forward a designated route with **physical obstacles** that can throw your game pieces out of game. Inspired by mechanics of video game Fall guys, or real life version Total Wipeout we mashed the two ideas and added a theme of a children's **camp night games**.

The path lighting up the way through different, moody environments leading you back to the safety of the camp. But beware! There are obstacles you need to get past to. May the luck be ever in your favour!

### Leatherworks Tlustý
*(brand identity, rebranding)*

![Logo rebranded](Tlusty_logo.gif)

Brašnářství Tlustý is a Czech company engaged in production of products that contain very high quality leather from Italy and are processed by hand. 
The current logo has an element of **seams** or **stitching** - element not used by competitors - it is **distinctive to the company** and is already familiar to the current customer base. It is easy to animate and apply. Its **practicality and uniqueness** to the trade made it clearly main element in the company's visual language.
