### Czech School without Borders, London
(Visual identity)

![Czech School logo](CzechSchool_uvod.png)

This is a visual identity for Czech School without Borders, London and together we designed a **versatile** visual system, reflecting the **unique** and **creative** educational process of the school. We created a **playful iconography** based on sticker like appearance. It is not only **fun element** but also **practical tool** to classify all the activities the school provides. We wanted to **incorporate children** themselves to be part of their school identity by using their precious artworks and creations.
