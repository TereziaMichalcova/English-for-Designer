## Process

- First thing I did was writing my heart out - soul searching - couldn't find a topic to talk about so I poured everything I had on my mind about my life journey.

- writing first draft was hard, making a sense of what I wanted to write was pure chaos. But I managed to make it somehow reasonable. I thought at first my story would be about routine and why it's good/bad.

- But second revision lead me to a different point of the story – finding creativity throughout my teen and adult life. Than I added some sources and books that I read on the topic and that helped me with my creative journey.

- The last step was adding pictures thus making presentation – I had to go out and take some more pictures so I would be satisfied with the results. And I hope you enjoyed reading my storytelling!

Have a meowtastic day!
