Hola soy Teresa and I would be a student of graphic design, let me show you my chaotic life. 

presentation:

1. To have a routine or not to?
2. Thatâ€™s me. Teresa. My biggest goals at that time were to do as much trouble as possible. And my parent would agree that I indeed was the trouble. 
3. (thug life) Sweet times. As a kid I naturally did all the things that just happened to go through my mind. Spontaneity of child is fascinating. Child isnâ€™t afraid of the outcome, consequences of their actions. They just try and hope for the best. Well, washing a cat in a brand new inflatable pool wasnâ€™t my brightest ideaâ€¦  but I wasnâ€™t afraid of trying things, doing things, exploring things. 
4. In primary school I was asked to sit still and listen. I enjoyed learning new things. Even though I had problem to relearn writing properly. Because I taught myself to write from right to left and mirrored. And that made great sense to me as a left handed individual. It wasn't excepted very well by my teachers.
5. Then I went to grammar school when I was 11 and stayed there until 18. I had routine, I was excersising a lot, I went to art class. But I would say I was creative much. I did what I saw. Ordinarily copying things â€“ which is also important part of learning new techniques etc. But I had no great ideas at that time. It was normalised thinking and institutionalised creativity that I was portraying.
6. Architecture got the best and worst of me. I was failing to have balanced lifestyle. I havenâ€™t slept much, ate maybe once a day and walking to school was the only physical activity I had for some time. I was exhausted and surprised myself when very late at night I came up with a great idea, or quickly sketched something and the next day showed it to teachers and they would say its great.
7. With graphic design I can have the best of both worlds. Sort of ðŸ˜ƒ. I have great ideas late at night. But I need to work on them after a good sleep during day. When I am tired at night I feel like I loose prudence and rationality I normally have. Its like a magic incantation and they vanish into thin air and my imagination can run free.
8. Working with Czech School in London I got to see London twice that year 
9. Throughout my life you can see how creativity went up and down. From being held hostage by learned rationality and system, through being strictly realistic and finally being able to be the 2yo in my creative process.
10. So is the routine needed to be creative? I think not, it rather wants a free course
