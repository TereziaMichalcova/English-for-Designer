Hi there, I am Teresa and I am a student of graphic design. So let me show you my chaotic life. 

1. Wavering Creativity
2. That‚Äôs me. Teresa. My biggest goals at that time were to do as much trouble as possible. And my parents would agree that I indeed was the trouble.\

3. (thug life) Sweet times. As a kid I naturally did all the things that just happened to go through my mind. Spontaneity of child is fascinating. Child isn‚Äôt afraid of the outcome, consequences of their actions. They just try and hope for the best. Well, washing a cat in a brand new inflatable pool wasn‚Äôt my brightest idea‚Ä¶  but I wasn‚Äôt afraid of trying things, doing things, exploring things. 
4. In primary school I was asked to sit still and listen. I enjoyed learning new things. Even though I had problem to relearn writing properly. Because I taught myself to write from right to left and mirrored. And that made great sense to me as a left-handed individual ‚Äì I didn't have to push the pen against the paper but slide it like right-handed people naturally have in a left-to-right writing system. My way wasn't accepted very well by my teachers. 
5. Then I went to grammar school when I was 11yo and stayed there until 18. I had routine, I was excercising a lot, I went to art class. But I wouldn‚Äôt say I was creative much. I did what I saw. Ordinarily reproducing things ‚Äì which is also important part of learning new techniques etc. But I had no great ideas at that time. It was normalised thinking and institutionalised creativity that I was portraying. 
6. Architecture got the best and worst of me. I was failing to have balanced lifestyle. I haven‚Äôt slept much, ate maybe once a day and walking to school was the only physical activity I had for some time. I was exhausted and surprised myself when very late at night I came up with a great idea, or quickly sketched something and the next day showed it to teachers and they would say it‚Äôs great.
7. Also on my example we can see how our education system - from kindergarten to collage - tends to promote uniformity and standardisation, draining people of their natural creative powers as said Sir Ken Robinson in his book [Out of Our Minds: The Power of Being Creative](https://www.sirkenrobinson.com/product/out-of-our-minds-the-power-of-being-creative/). Our system prioritises getting right answers over promoting creative responses. Standardised testing negatively affects creativity by conditioning us to seek a single solution for every problem. The focus on mental compliance rather than innovative expression limits our creative possibilities. By studying architecture I was somewhat in the middle ‚Äì being expected to be creative but the university system was so rigid it was not possible for me to get past it.
8. With graphic design I can have the best of both worlds. Pretty much üòÉ. I have great ideas late at night. But I get to work on them after a good sleep during day. When I am tired at night I feel like I loose prudence and rationality I normally have. It‚Äôs like a magic incantation and they vanish into thin air and my imagination can run free. 
9. Throughout my life you can see how my creativity wavered. From being held hostage by learned rationality and system, through being strictly realistic and finally being able to be the 2yo in my creative process. I had to break free from the strict rationalism and find again my creative inner child. Since I can‚Äôt change the system, I needed to redesign my thinking. By exposing myself to new situations, reading books, writing diary, taking long walks, staying late and doing ‚Äúchildish‚Äù activities like gluing googly eyes on statues has helped me to connect with my creative self again. I certainly recommend reading a book from Julia Cameron called [The Artist‚Äôs Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity](https://juliacameronlive.com/books-by-julia/the-artists-way-a-spiritual-path-to-higher-creativity-audiobook/) that also helped me getting unstuck and be free again.
10. What I'll tell you in conclusion... Creativity is a journey that takes time, rediscovering yourself from the ground up, connecting with your own emotions, and a lot of patience with yourself because we can feel silly, dissatisfied, irrational, or childish along the way. But hey! We were born to be creative, so let's remember that and work towards it.
