## Rough Draft

_whatever 
_no offence but
_interesting
_love

While choosing the word I realised, we have more negative connotations with words than the positive ones. Or at least that it is what comes to our minds first. Maybe it is easier to annoy someone with just one always repeating word than to positively encourage with one. It is a mystery to me. Maybe it’s harder to express really a heart touching praise to someone. Anywho and anyhow for a long time I couldn’t come up with a great word to write about, but this morning the idea came to me. Finally. 
The very well known, the very much overused in wrong context and space and time: Love. We love everything. From our morning coffee, neighbour’s dog, coworker’s new shirt to random statements of I love it and I love that all day long. Many of us are guilty of misusing this word for insignificant things, matters and situations. Although the use of ‘love' might differ language from language. In Czech we are not so used to using it as a phrase for expressing affection for a thing or an idea as much as in the US. In every American tv show I watched over the past few years there is always the one character that says it in every single sentence. I can clearly picture Sookie from Gilmore girls enthusiastically saying: “I just love it!” to Lorelai on some ingenious idea she had. Why not to just say: “That is ingenious idea, let’s do it!” instead? Or I really like it, that is a fantastic idea, that sounds amazing and definitely there is more phrases to say in such situation. 
Ain’t that too bad the word love has become so ordinary? Isn’t it supposed to be for the special person, people in your life. Not sure about the special occasion. If we say - I love you - too little to the loved one, that is rather sad I think. It is the balance of things. In this age when we like to twist and turn meanings of words to however we see fit for the moment and as a result we get confused. Then why to waste such a beautiful meaningful word such is “love” for pointless interactions in our life? Our words have more power than we admit to, so let’s think more about what we say, and let’s be more intentional with our narration. Because saying I love you, can also mean for someone: “…you have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love--I love--I love you. I never wish to be parted from you from this day on.”
