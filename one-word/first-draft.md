## First Draft

Hello dear reader I love that you stumbled upon this page. You look very stylish, love that shirt on you. I would love to show you what I wrote. I loved this assignment we got for our English lesson and I would love for you to read it. It is about one very well known word, very much overused in wrong context and space and time and that word would be: love.\
As I exaggerated in the first paragraph we love everything. From our morning coffee, neighbour’s dog, coworker’s new shirt to random statements of I love it and I love that all day long. Many of us are guilty of misusing this word for insignificant things, matters and situations.\
Although the use of ‘love' might differ language from language. In Czech we are not so used to using it as a phrase for expressing affection for a thing or an idea as much as in the US. We tend to be less affectionate or expressive, and I think it is because how our language works. We use another superlative like ‘adore’, when it is not an understatement as ‘like’ but it is still less affectionate as ‘love’ but very close to it, therefore more suitable for ordinary things. In Czech we use ‘love' only if we have feelings for it or we cannot live without it, it's an inseparable part of us - not just carelessly as saying your coworker I love your sweater randomly.\
And now back to English. In every American tv show I watched over the past few years there is always the one character that says it in every single sentence. I can clearly picture Sookie from Gilmore girls enthusiastically saying: “I just love it!” to Lorelai on some ingenious idea she had. Why not to just say: “That is ingenious idea, let’s do it!” instead? Or I really like it, that is a fantastic idea, that sounds amazing and definitely there is more phrases to say in such situation.\
Ain’t that too bad the word love has become so ordinary? Isn’t it supposed to be for the special person, people, rituals in your life. Not sure about the special occasion. If we say - I love you - too little to the loved one, that is rather sad I think. It is the balance of things. In this age when we like to twist and turn meanings of words to however we see fit for the moment and as a result we get confused. Then why to waste such a beautiful meaningful word such is “love” for pointless interactions in our life? Our words have more power than we admit to, so let’s think more about what we say, and let’s be more intentional with our narration. Because saying I love you, can also mean for someone: “…you have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love--I love--I love you. I never wish to be parted from you from this day on.”.


My notes:
_adore different meaning in Czech 
_Love used only if you have feelings for it, you cannot live without it - not carelessly as saying you love new sweater of your friend
