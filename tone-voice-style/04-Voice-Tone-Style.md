# Voice, Tone, and Style

## Voice

- serious – most often when talking to people I sound serious, or kind of neutral or practical. The way I talk is pretty ordinary and straight to the point.
- candid – I am sort of a candid observer, usually more listening to other people and being honest in my conversation with them.
- dry(er) humour – I am not very humorous gal and my type of hum(ou)r (humr=lobster 🦞) is pretty specific and not everybody finds it funny, but when they do we have a good laugh together.
- divagate – my storytelling is often interrupted by random details I remembered or I forget where I was going with the conversation.

## Tone

The first thing I do is to try and read the room, so my tone of voice isn't out of place. I am never to speak first, unless I am comfortable enough with the people. 

And I strive to be with everybody:

- understanding – in general I am trying to be understanding 🫱🏼‍🫲🏽
- kind – because there is never enough kindness 🌸
- supportive – everyone needs to be praised and appreciated 🥳

## Style

A lot of the times I mix Czech, Slovak and English together, I use informal style and talk in slang (gen z slang specifically)… so I am a pretty weird one. But when needed I am able to speak and write in proper language. My teachers were strict and I read a lot, resulting in good spelling and good grammar. In English though, I am more carefree with it. I don’t need to be perfect to get along in the world. I use language freely and everything is accepted (just no need for vulgarism).
